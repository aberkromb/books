Start low or start high? Which will make people buy?
====================================================

## Take away
* Offer a low entry-barrier
* Increase participation and let people be engaged by using Social Proof
* People will justify the energy spent in the process with an increased commitment.

## Summary
In a bid, such as the ones on eBay, when the initial price for an item is high, as a potential buyer, you're likely to think it's worth more than if the initial price were lower. Yet, in an experiment, social psychologists wondered whether the increase in perceived value that comes along with a high starting price would actually lead to a higher final sale price.

Indeed, based on their research, they suggest that *lower* starting prices can actually lead to a higher final sale price, for 3 reasons.

1. Because the starting prices for auctions act as somewhat of a barrier to entry, lower starting prices are better at encouraging participation.
2. The increase in traffic acts as a social proof (see [chapter 1](1.md)) for new potential bidders: prospective bidders find social validation that the items is of value because so many more people were also bidding on the item.
3. In an effor to justify the time and energy the bidders have already spent on the bidding process, these bidders are more likely to stay committed to winning the auctio by continuing to bid (see [Loss Aversion](34.md)

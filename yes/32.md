What kind of smile can make the world smile back?
=================================================

## Take away
Search other people for their virtues instead of for their faults.

## Summary

People can often distinguish between authentic and unauthentic smiles, even though the difference between the two types of smiles is very subtle.

If you fake your smile, those you deal with may very well frown back.

A more general approach is to try to follow the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin: "Search others for their virtues". Many of us spend too much time finding faults in the people we deal with in our everyday lives. If, instead, we try to search their character for what we like about them, we'll like them more; and, as a result, they'll like us more.

Which faults unlock people's vaults?
====================================

## Take-away
Communicate the little faults, but pair the message with a compensating positive message that is related to, and that neutralizes, the drawback.

## Summary

Although the  advertising campaign for Volkwagen Beetle seemed to handle its product's faults deftly, we are left with a dilemma: which little faults should we choose to confess?

For "two-sided" persuasive appeals to be maximally effective, there must be a clear connection between the negative and positive attributes that are conveyed.

A small restaurant could use th message "There's little space, **but** that's part of what makes the atmosphere cozy". In short, although both types of two-sded messages produced increases in the restaurant owners' perceived credibility, the evaluation of the restaurant itself was highest in the two-sided messages in which the positive and negative attributes were related.

You would be well advised to ensure that any dard cloud you describe is paired with a silved lining tailored to that particular cloud.

Be sure to follow your discussion of a drawback with a positive aspect that's related to, and that neutralizes, the drawback.

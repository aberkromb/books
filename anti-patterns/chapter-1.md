Introduction to Patterns and AntiPatterns
=========================================

Many of the most significant problems are generated from the human processes that require shared vision, cooperation, and collaoration to realize systems. The majority of works in software science have focused on positive, constructive solutions. This book starts by looking at the negative solutions.

Virtually all systems delivered are *stovepipe systems*, systems that cannot accomodate change. Adaptability is perhaps the most important quality of software

## AntiPatters: AntiHype
Software was supposed to make digital hardware much more flexible. We have seen many software fads come and go (Structured programming, Artificial Intelligence, Object Orientation etc). Yet we have stovepipe systems. Why?

### The Truth about Software Technology

#### Vendors will tell you
After purchasing a software license, vendors expect to make four times as much money from the same customer fro training, consulting, support and maintenance.

## What is an AntiPattern
An AntiPattern is a literary form that describes a commonly occurring solution to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences.

It may be the result of having applied a perfectly good pattern in the wrong context.

### Where did AntiPatterns Come From?
Design Pattern languages have taken the programming community by storm, and reflect an intense desire from software professionals to improve the quality and standards of the industry.

Christopher Alexander's method of capturing expertise was innovative, as it made explicit many of the "soft" attributes that were previously attainable only through years of experience in planning and building towns


In 1987 Ward Cunningham and Kend Back developer a design pattern language for developing user interfaces in Smalltalk.

Christopher Alexander believed tht while most processes involved in designing physical structures were variable, there was always a single common invariant process underlying all other processes, which precisely defined the principles of the structure's design and consutruction.

Initial industry reaction was universally positive, as the vocabulary and design focus was elevated from the level of data structures and programming idioms to the architecture level, and *facades*, *adapters*, and *visitors* became well-known terms in the design discussions.

The dard side is that many of the people who use design patterns fail to properly evaluate how aplicable a particular design pattern of pattern language is to their specific set of design concern. In addition, some developers, armed with their packaged knowledge, eagerly rush in to classify everthing as a Desifn Pattern or solvable by a specific set of Design Patterns before attempting to perform and complete their domain analysis.

Given the frequency of sofware defects and project failures, negative solutions are probably a much richer field to study (a so-called *targe-rich environment*).


We present AntiPatterns from 3 perspectives:

* developer: technical problems and solutions that are encountered by programmers
* architect: problems in how systems are structured
* manager: common problems in software processes and development organizations

#### Portland Pattern Repository
The [Portland Pattern Repository](https://c2.com/ppr) publishes an evolving collection of design patterns and pattern languages.
